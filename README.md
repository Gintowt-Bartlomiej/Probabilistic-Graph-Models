## Overview
This repository contains laboratory assignments and projects related to **probabilistic graphical models (PGMs)**.  
The work focuses on both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of PGMs, including:

- **Bayesian networks** and **Markov random fields**,  
- Probabilistic inference techniques (exact and approximate),  
- Learning model parameters and structures from data,  
- Applications of PGMs in reasoning under uncertainty and machine learning.
